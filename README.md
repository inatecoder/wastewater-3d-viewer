# 3D Wastewater Treatment Plant Visualization

This project is an interactive 3D visualization of the stages of a wastewater treatment plant, built using Three.js. It displays slides from a presentation for each stage and for additional informational points.

## How to Use

1.  **Add Your Slide Images**: Export your PowerPoint slides as images (e.g., `.png` or `.jpg`). Place them in the `/slides` directory.
2.  **Check Filenames**: The `js/main.js` file is configured to look for specific filenames in the `/slides` directory. Make sure your images are named correctly as specified in the `STAGES_DATA` array in that file.
3.  **Open `index.html`**: Open the `index.html` file in your local browser to see the visualization.
4.  **Deploy**: The project is ready to be deployed as a static website.
